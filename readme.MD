**Red Part** - Concealed a $2$-arg function within an executable as part of a team of two, using techniques such as packing, obfuscation, encryption, requiring a password, no symbol table and without compiler optimization to prevent hacks. 
**Blue Part** - Broke executables of five teams using ideas such as bypassing password checks with gdb and using reverse engineering toolkit [cutter.re](https://cutter.re/). No one broke our executable.
